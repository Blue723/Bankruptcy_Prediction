This dataset aims to predict bankruptcy for Banks. In the Modeling Classifiers notebook I used various models to exemplify their modeling accuracy. I used pipelines and adjusted some hyperparameters and showed their accuracy scores. I enjoyed workig with this dataset thus far and would like to continue adjusting the features to make for more realistic models.
